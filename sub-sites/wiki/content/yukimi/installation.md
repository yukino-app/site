# Installing Yukimi

## Step 1: Download executable from releases

Download the pre-built binaries from [releases](https://github.com/yukino-org/yukimi/releases).

-   For Windows: `yukimi-windows.exe`
-   For Linux: `yukimi-linux`
-   For MacOS: `yukimi-macos`

## Step 2: Rename it (Optional)

Once you have downloaded the correct executable, go ahead and move it to an appropriate folder and rename it to just `yukimi.exe` (in Windows) or `yukimi` (in Linux and MacOS). You can also add it to your `PATH` environment variable if you want to access it from anywhere.

## Step 3: That's it

Now you can open the terminal in that folder and run `yukimi help` to get started.
