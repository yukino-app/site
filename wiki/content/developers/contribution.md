# Contribution

Yukino follows certain guidelines to maintain code integrity and uniformity. It is _required_ to follow these guidelines in order for you to contribute.

## Before-hand

-   I appreciate any contributions to any of the repository and every single feedback. And don't feel bad if your issue or pull request was closed. 🙂
-   Always check if it the right repository before opening an issue or a pull request.
-   Check if there is a similar issue or a pull request before committing.
-   Refer similar or other issues or pull requests if it's your first time.

## Guidelines

-   Always follow the same conventions used in the project. (Example: Using `snake_case` when necessary, organizing files according to their use)
-   Always follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
-   Always document the changes you have made.
-   Always follow same versioning of the corresponding project. (Example: [SemVer](http://semver.org/))
-   An issue or a pull request must be related to only one topic. Do not make a pull request containing multiple feature or bug fixes.
-   Always ask for reviews before asking to merge a pull request.
-   Always try to use the pre-defined templates for issues and pull requests. Make sure to fill it completely. Invalid issues or pull requests will be _closed_.
-   Keep it as professional as possible.
